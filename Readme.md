# Steps to run the Code
1. run the file code.py: python ./code.py
2. Specify the path to the directory that contain the files to be indexedd
3. Submit the Query to see the result.

# Project Specifications:


1. Either create your own IR system or modify an existing one. If you create your own, explain all components. If you modify an existing system, explain changes made.

2. Experiment with at least two tokenization methods. If the system has only one tokenization method, devise a variant of that by examining the dataset. In other words, develop suitable strategies for extracting words from the text.

3. Compare stemming and no stemming.

4. Compare stopword removal vs. no stopword removal.

5. Compare different ranking methods: TF, TF-IDF, etc.

6. Use different performance metrics: P, R, F, P@rank, DCG, NDCG, ...
